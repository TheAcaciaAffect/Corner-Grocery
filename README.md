For this course, I chose to include my Corner Grocer item-tracking program in my portfolio. The goal of this project was to analyze a daily transaction log and report how often grocery items were purchased. The program allows users to search for a specific item, display a full frequency list, and visualize the data using a text-based histogram. This project focused on applying object-oriented programming principles in C++, including class design, file input/output, pointers, and memory management.

One area I feel I did particularly well was designing the program structure to be readable and modular. I separated responsibilities clearly by using classes to encapsulate data, which made the logic easier to follow and reduced repetition. I also focused on meaningful variable names and in-line comments so that someone unfamiliar with the project could still understand how it works. If I were to enhance this code further, I would improve input validation and error handling to make the program more robust and user-friendly, especially when dealing with unexpected file changes or invalid menu input.

The most challenging part of this project was managing dynamic memory correctly while following object-oriented design requirements. Working with pointers, constructors, destructors, and assignment behavior required careful attention to avoid memory leaks or shallow copies. I overcame this by reviewing zyBooks examples, testing frequently, and breaking problems down into smaller steps before integrating them. Skills from this project that will transfer well to future coursework include class design, linked data structures, debugging pointer-related issues, and writing maintainable C++ code that aligns with industry standards. Overall, this project strengthened my confidence in writing clean, adaptable programs and documenting my work in a way that supports long-term reuse.
